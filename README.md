LaTeX
=====

These are all my works written in LaTeX, a repo to new projects and to remember how some LaTeX tricks were done.

I'll keep only the .tex and .pdf files of old projects, so I
can see the result on the .pdf and find the code on the
.tex. Orinally I was going to keep all images and asides so
I could compile the project, but keeping those files made my
folder big in memory and it isn't really necessary.
